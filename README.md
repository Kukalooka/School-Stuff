# This repo is for for small bits of C++ code

Since I have to make a lot of these small algorithms for my classes, I decided to put them on GitHub for easier access.

Inside of main.cpp you'll find things I was recently working on, while in the "Submitted" directory you'll find work I already turned in and stopped working on.

Don't expect anything in this repo to be graceful, or useful in any way. This is just a playground for learning things... or just things I have to turn in to get credits...
